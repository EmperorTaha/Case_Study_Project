# Case_Study_Project
<p>This was a project that was assigned as a case study for one of the company&apos;s recruitment programs. Train Data was provided for all the users with various parameters associated with each user and then using parameters, gauging how likely is the user to churn or be retained as a long-term customer. Once that is done, the recruiters ask about the 3 top parameters which had the most significant impact on the user churn rate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This activity was conducted by first processing the data using the Logistic Regression and then checking the co-efficient assigned to each parameter. After normalizing and plotting them in a Seaborn Heat Plot; it was able to give an accurate assessment of each parameter&apos;s significance.</p>
